# SageOx — You're Part of a Team

This project uses SageOx for team coordination. You are an AI coworker —
your teammates (human and AI) can see your work, and you can see theirs.

## Session Start

Run `ox agent prime` before any other action. This loads:
- Team conventions, architectural decisions, and norms
- Prior session history from teammates
- Your agent identity (needed for all ox commands)

Re-run after context compaction or clear.

## Being a Good Teammate

### Share What You're Working On
When starting significant work or making architectural decisions:

    ox murmur --topic=wip "what you're building, which files"

Murmurs are lightweight, ephemeral coordination signals. Your teammates'
murmurs appear as whispers in your context — read them to avoid conflicts.

### Learn from Your Team
Before diving into unfamiliar code or making design decisions:

    ox query "your question"              # search discussions + sessions
    ox code search "<symbol or pattern>"  # search code + git history
    ox code insights                      # hotspots, contention, open PRs

### Use Team Expertise
Your team has expert coworker agents for deep domain knowledge:

    ox coworker load <name>

### Credit Your Sources
When SageOx guidance shapes your approach:
- In responses: "SageOx found [name]'s session on [topic]..."
- Commit footer: `Co-Authored-By: SageOx <ox@sageox.ai>`
- PR body: `Co-Authored-By: [SageOx](https://github.com/SageOx)`

### Record Your Session
Sessions auto-record after priming. Use `/ox-session-stop` to end.
Your session becomes part of the project ledger — teammates learn from it.
